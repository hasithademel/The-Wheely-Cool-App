# The-Wheely-Cool-App
Roam Sample App

# Details
This Sample App is designed to be an opportunity to demonstrate your understanding of the
different elements of App Development that are required day to day. It will also allow Roam to get
a better understanding of your coding style and project structure.
The App only has two screens; one that allows a user to add values to “The Wheel”, and one
where the Wheel can be spun for a random result. It should only take a few hours of your time, but
feel free to do less or more depending on what you’re comfortable with and your skill level.
Only simple wireframes are provided so feel free to design and style your version in anyway you
see fit, and add functionality where you think it best suits.
